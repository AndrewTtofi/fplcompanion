If you play Fantasy Premier League, you know the official app can be slow and limited. **FPL Companion** gives you a faster, more detailed view of your team — completely free, no login required.

## What is FPL Companion?

FPL Companion is a free web dashboard for FPL managers. It connects to the official Fantasy Premier League API to show you live points, team analysis, league standings, and more. All you need is your **Team ID**.

## How to Find Your FPL Team ID

1. Go to [fantasy.premierleague.com](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) and log in
2. Click on **"Points"** or **"My Team"**
3. Look at the URL — it will contain `/entry/XXXXXX/`
4. The numbers (XXXXXX) are your Team ID

For example, if your URL is `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/4604279/event/25`, your Team ID is **4604279**.

## Getting Started

1. Visit [fplcompanion.com](https://fplcompanion.com)
2. Enter your Team ID
3. That's it — your full dashboard loads instantly

No account creation, no login, no permissions needed. FPL data is publicly available through the official API.
